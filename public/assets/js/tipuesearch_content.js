        {"title":"What to Know When a Major Storm Hits", "text": "The storm on July 21st ravaged much of Illinois, and people are starting to see how much damage it truly caused. In some parts of Elk Grove, homes with vinyl siding look like swiss cheese after the hail. Other areas had broken windows or their roofs destroyed. At times like this, people often act hastily and open themselves up to scam artists and hack contractors who prey on homeowners’ ignorance to gain their “business.” Being aware of what’s really needed, can keep you safe. Understanding Your Home’s Needs and Local Building Codes A roof is a system. In addition to shingles, there are flashings, a drip edge, ice and water felt, and more that go into making that system work. Your city, state, and county all have strict guidelines that must be followed to remain in compliance with the code. Despite what their advertisements claim, insurance companies do not create billions of dollars of wealth and investments by properly taking care of you. Insurance adjusters, many of whom are from out of state, want to settle whenever they can. Their goal is to get out quickly and move on for the least amount possible. While the check and price offered may seem high, many insurance companies pay way below market value for home repairs. Thanks to their strict internal guidelines there are many legitimate items they are not authorized to pay for, even when your city or county calls for it. This is when things can get confusing for the homeowner: Your insurance company agrees to pay you $10,000 for a smaller roof. From that amount, your deductible will be removed; as that’s your portion to pay your contractor, or whomever, you decide to perform the work. From there, you go out and start to get estimates. You absolutely don’t trust contractors, and your insurance adjuster told you not to let the contractors know the estimate given by the insurance company, so you keep that information to yourself. The first estimate provided is for $7,000. You think that’s great! I have enough to do the work, but then you decide to get a few more estimates just to be safe. Two more come in at $12,000 and another comes in as high as $14,000. Now things are weird, so you start to get even more estimates. Let me tell you; contractors can be competitive. However, they can usually be only so competitive with their profit. From that point, they must cut corners. THAT’S WHERE THE TROUBLE IS! See, if a contractor wants to give a lower price, there’s a line where they will have to start acting much like the auto industry and not offer “options”; no Bluetooth, no leather seats, etc. Only, in this case, the Bluetooth and leather seating are required by your county. From the outside, it looks the same, but any real auto expert would have a much different experience while in the car. From the outside of your home, your new roof may look better than the previous one but once evaluated it would reveal a different story. Assembling a new car with old parts won’t work well or last very long. The same goes for your roofing system. Old flashings or other ways of cutting corners always shortens the life span of the roof and leaves you open to more problems. Make sure your Contractor or Public Adjuster is on your Team A competitive environment is what drives the insurance restoration world. Insurance companies will continuously tell you someone can do the job for cheaper, but they never tell you they can do it better for cheaper. That’s because quality isn’t the insurance company’s responsibility, it’s yours. Having a reputable contractor or public adjuster from day one will solve most of these headaches for you. Good companies will review the insurance company’s estimate and make sure it follows all local guidelines. They will also make sure you pay nothing more than your deductible for repairs. The same goes for siding, windows, and other parts damaged by a storm. The people waving deductibles, and offering money back, etc. are committing crimes and laws set by the Department of Insurance. These companies do not plan to be around to warranty their work. They are setting things up to move to another storm for as long as possible until Karma catches up with them. At first glance, a reputable contractor may be more expensive, but that’s because he holds the proper licensing and insurance. He will be able to submit documentation of local codes, estimates, etc. to make sure your home remains in compliance with local and state ordinances. It’s important to do your due diligence when it comes to having your home repaired and keep an open book with your contractor. One of the very first things Renowned Building Solutions does is keep everything open from day one. We set proper expectations, discuss wants vs. needs, upgrades, ideal repair, and so on. Remember, if you want your contractor to be honest with you, you need to be honest with them from the get go. You both should have the same goal, and that’s to repair your home.

            {"title":"Roof Repair vs. Replacement", "text": "Listen, this isn’t just another article telling you to replace your roof when it’s easily repairable. If your roof is within the lifespan and doesn’t show significant damage, repair may be the best option. On the other side of the coin, is the homeowner who tries to save his roof till the bitter end; often far beyond manufacturer specifications. In my experience, I’ve encountered roofs with more than six different types of mismatched shingles varying in life-span of two years old to over 30. In these cases, replacement is, unfortunately, the only option. To figure out which side your roof falls on, here are five reasons to repair instead of replace. Age of your Roof This is one of the biggest tells. If the age of your roof still falls way below manufacturer’s warranty, repair could be your best bet. Often newer roofs may have a shingle or two come off in high wind situations. There could also be just one improperly installed shingle. Whatever the case, if the age of your roof is significantly lower than the manufacturer’s warranty; look at ways to repair instead of replace. Condition of your Shingles There is another sign that keeps your roof eligible for repair, and it is the current condition of your shingles. Some roofs have been taken off the market for not living up to their lifespan. Others may have significantly more wear and tear due to climate, venting, and other factors. If the shingles themselves are in relatively good condition repair may be possible. Quantity of Needed Repairs Sometimes a roof’s repair may be more trouble than just replacing it. We inspected a roof years ago where the tar strip had completely failed on the shingles. The homeowner requested a quote to reseal every shingle on his roof. In this case, the repair process would have cost him just about the same as replacement due to the meticulous labor. A qualified roofer will be helpful in determining this if you are unsure. Cause for Repair There will be times when you are being told to take the less expensive road; maybe an insurance adjuster recommended repairs or your handyman suggested saving money by putting off buying a new roof because it was just a little wind. If the wind blew a shingle or two, but the roof is in otherwise great condition, repair could be a good choice. On the other hand, if hail affects multiple full slopes and the adjuster is suggesting only repairs, it may be time to get another opinion. Numerous repairs in multiple sections could mean a new roof is the best way to fix it. You Have Other Things to Worry About Life is life, and roof replacements can get expensive. ‘Repair til forever’ has become many homeowners battle cry over the last decade; as long as the leak stops they’re happy. There are many roofs we have walked away from because, as a company, we want to stand behind our work and warranty. On the other hand, there are a number of handymen who roof pretty well and would be happy making a few bucks and saving you a whole lot by trying to continue to patch the problems indefinitely. The only problem with this method is by the time a full roof replacement is possible it is even more expensive due to bad plywood, new layers, excess in roof tar, etc. I hope this answered a few of your questions in regards to Repairing vs. Replacing your Roof.

        {"title":"What are the Benefits of a &quot;Green Roof&quot;?", "text": "When you hear the term “green roof,” you might assume that you know exactly what it means—a roof that uses green technology to be more energy efficient or environmentally friendly. But while green roofs do embody these characteristics, what you might not expect is that they are literally green with plant growth. A green roof is a roof covered in grasses and other plants, designed to provide a host of benefits to the building’s energy efficiency, minimize the impact on the health of the environment, and the increase the overall enjoyment people can get from the structure if the roof is accessible. If you’re looking to retrofit your roof, or if you’re interested in ways to save energy and reduce your environmental footprint, green roofs are a good option to look into. Here are the basics you need to know when considering a green roof. INTENSIVE AND EXTENSIVE GREEN ROOFS Green roofs are generally divided into two categories, intensive and extensive, which differ in the roles they play and the variety of functions they can serve. Intensive green roofs are essentially rooftop gardens. With complex irrigation, drainage, and structural support systems, they can support flower beds, shrubs, trees, walkways, and benches. It’s practically a complete park right on the roof, making use of a commonly disused space to provide animals habitats and people a place to relax for a bit without ever leaving the building. Extensive green roofs, by contrast, don’t serve these functions and are put in place primarily for ecological and cost-saving reasons. Since they use native ground cover which is much lighter than the foot or more of growing medium required for intensive green roofs, they require less maintenance, are much lighter, and cost less. There are also semi-intensive and mixed systems which combine aspects of intensive and extensive green roofing. The most prominent example of this in the Chicagoland area is the ROOFTOP GARDEN ON CHICAGO CITY HALL. BENEFITS OF GREEN ROOFS Because green roofs have relatively high installation costs compared to other kinds of roofs, with simpler extensive roofing starting at $10 PER SQUARE FOOT and intensive roofing starting at $25 PER SQUARE FOOT, owners may first be apprehensive about green roofs and want to know more about them before committing. However, these startup costs are offset by the massive savings in energy costs and maintenance that green roofs bestow. Because a green roof provides superior insulation, it can DRASTICALLY CUT YOUR ENERGY COSTS. And since green roofs do such a good job of protecting the roof membrane from UV radiation and harsh weather, they LAST TWICE AS LONG, reducing replacement costs as well. Green roofs are also beneficial in the larger scope as well. Not are they better at maintaining stable temperatures in your home, but the plants absorb sunlight and cool the air around them in a process called evapotranspiration. This mitigates the effects of HEAT ISLANDS, a term used to describe the heat that builds up on manmade surfaces and results in extreme heat fluctuations in more urban areas, like when you walk through a parking lot where the heat seems to be radiating from the pavement. Because green roofs create cooler locales, some cities even offer incentives for installing green roofs. And of course, beyond the financial benefits, there are also the environmental benefits. In addition to the reduced greenhouse gas emissions provided by lower energy usage, green roofs also generate oxygen and can provide habitats for birds and other wildlife. They also trap rainwater, letting the plants soak it up and releasing the rest gradually, reducing water runoff and sewer overflows. Overall, a green roof is a solid choice to consider for reasons of economy, environmental responsibility, and beauty. If you’re thinking about this or other types of roofing for your own building, though, you’ll need a contractor you can trust who can answer your questions.", "tags": "", "url": "http://staging.kevinoneill.me/blog/what-are-the-benefits-of-a-green-roof/"},

        {"title":"4 Roofing Mistakes to Avoid", "text": "The roof is your home’s first line of defense against the harsh conditions of nature. Keeping it properly maintained will not only provide a good first impression for onlookers or potential buyers, it will also help preserve everything within your home, including you! Therefore, a properly maintained roof is of extreme importance. That being said, you should be aware of the common mistakes made when attempting to do it yourself. MISTAKE 1: DOING IT YOURSELF Roofing is not a DIY project. If you have never done this before, don’t start now. We are talking about the roof on your home, your shelter from the weather conditions. Not to mention how dangerous and difficult replacing your roof on your own can be. Inexperience and the hopes to save a few bucks can in turn ended up costing much more in the end. MISTAKE 2: PURCHASING SUPPLIES ON YOUR OWN OR CHEAP SUPPLIES There is a time and place for buying the cheapest option. When it comes to the roof over your head, you don’t want to use the bargain brand. This certainly does not mean that you need to buy the most expensive supplies either. By allowing a qualified contractor to step in and use their knowledge to find the best material for your specific situation you will save more than you think MISTAKE 3: NOT STRIPPING THE OLD ROOF FIRST Placing a new roof on top of the old one is like putting a band-aid on the problem. You might as well use duct tape. Although, you will seemingly save loads of time, money and stress by just covering your roof with a new one, it will not fix the problem. This will only force the new roof to take on the weaknesses of the original one, which will leave your home with unnecessary weight. MISTAKE 4: NOT HIRING A LICENSED CONTRACTOR FIRST If you are not experienced in this trade, don’t start now. Do some research and network to find a reputable roof CONTRACTOR in Crystal Lake to help ensure your roof is done properly. There are ways to save time and money and the right contractor can help you define what they are.", "tags": "", "url": "http://staging.kevinoneill.me/blog/4-roofing-mistakes-to-avoid/"},

        {"title":"Your Checklist When Buying a Home", "text": "You’re in the market for a new home so you’ve pulled up to a house that’s for sale, but you’ve barely made it past the sidewalk when suddenly you realize you don’t really know much about houses. What should I be looking for when buying a house? What if this place needs costly repairs and I’m getting a bad deal? What if I miss some damage in a place I didn’t think to check? How can I tell if everything’s in good condition or if major home improvement projects are necessary? Buying Without Home Improvement. It’s important that you come in with an idea of what you need to look at and what the potential trouble areas might be. Here are some key things to look for when judging the value of a new home. Temperature Control Of course you want to keep your bills low, and you want to live in comfort. A well-insulated home will help ensure both of these needs are met. Before you buy, you should check to make sure that the heating ducts, attic, and water pipes have proper insulation—otherwise, your heating and cooling systems will have to work overtime to compensate, and you’ll be hemorrhaging cash in your utility bills each month. This also puts unneeded strain on those systems, and the added wear and tear could result in them breaking down and needing to be replaced sooner. These are very expensive to replace, so you’ll want to check them out the furnace and cooling system to make surethey’re in working order, and the insulation so that you know they’ll stay that way. Watertight Plumbing The kitchen and bathrooms might have nice counter-tops, good fixtures, and clean tile, but what lies beneath may be a nightmare waiting to happen. Be sure to investigate what’s under every sink while the water is running to check the pipes, keeping an eye out for drips. Leakage can cause water damage or, worse yet, mold, which poses serious health risks to anyone breathing that air, especially children, asthmatics, and the elderly. Replacing plumbing can be time-consuming and expensive, and if the fittings are seized up then the cost and difficulty of replacement will be even greater—so while you’re down there, make sure not only that things are in working order, but that if something does go wrong down the line, it won’t be any harder to fix than it needs to be. The Surrounding Property The building itself isn’t the only important thing to be looking at when looking for a home. You should also be checking out the rest of the property. Make sure that there’s sufficient drainage and find out if the area is prone to flooding. Conversely, if it’s a dry climate, you should know whether wildfires are an issue, and what the water usage regulations and rates are. If the property has fencing, make sure it’s been positioned and constructed properly and doesn’t have damage that needs repairs. Look at whether the property has trees providing the amount of shade you want, but also whether it has plants that might produce harmful or annoying allergens. If you garden, will you have a good space to do that? If you have children or pets, will the property accommodate them running around and playing? There’s as much to consider when looking at the land around the house as there is when looking inside the house. Fresh Siding Siding is more than just a nice façade for making a house look finished. It’s also your primary defense against the elements. Not only can old siding result in unnecessarily high energy bills, but it can also let moisture seep into your home, bringing with it mold, mildew, and fungus. If this has already started, you may notice loose wallpaper and peeling paint inside the house in areas with compromised siding. Otherwise, you’ll have to inspect the siding itself, making sure to walk all the way around the house. Sometimes problems are easy to spot; cracks and holes, warping, bubbles, and rotting are all obvious red flags that the siding needs to be replaced if you’re planning on moving in. This could be a larger home improvement project then you would like. But something as simple as severely faded paint can tip you off as well. Ask when the siding was last repainted—good siding holds color for 8 to 10 years, so if it’s been having to be repainted frequently, it may be time for replacement. A New Roof While you’re out there looking at the siding, you should also make an effort to evaluate the roof. Again, this is more than just an issue of making the house look nice—new roofing protects your house from serious and expensive repairs down the line. Like with siding, a damaged roof will let in water, leading to mold, leaks, and possibly even structural damage and flooding. If roof damage is left not repaired, water can move unexpectedly from a problem areas to other sections of the roof. A weakened roof will also be more vulnerable to damage from wind and hail. These problems can add up to thousands in repair bills, insurance claims and home improvement time, so it’s in your best interest to give the roof a good once-over. Similar to siding, if water damage has already begun you might see water spots on the ceilings inside. Otherwise, check the roof for obvious signs of disrepair. Missing granules and shingles; algae and moss growth; rotting roof decking; and buckling, blistered, or curled areas should all be taken as warnings that this roof needs renovation. Making sure your home has a new roof will not only save you from the financial and emotional burden of dealing with serious damage later on that you could have avoided, but can also factor into netting you a lower homeowner’s insurance rate. These are a few of the things you can check out yourself when viewing a potential new home, but keep in mind that when you’re seriously considering a property you should call in a professional home inspector. A second set of eyes, especially one that is trained in what to look for, will ensure that you know what you’re getting when you buy a home you’re going to live in and love for years to come.", "tags": "", "url": "http://staging.kevinoneill.me/blog/your-checklist-when-buying-a-home/"},

        {"title":"Quality Windows Will Save You Money!", "text": "When looking for ways to save money, your windows probably aren’t the first things that come to mind. In fact, the investment in window replacement can feel far more like a financial burden than a way to save some money. But the reality is that your existing windows could be literally throwing your money out the window. Quality windows play a vital role in helping to maintain a strong air seal in your home. Heat lost through old windows can account for upwards of 25% of your HEATING BILL. Having a consistent, proper seal throughout your home is the main factor that keeps out unwanted drafts, helping your home to stay warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer without over working your air conditioner or furnace. So with that alone in mind, an appliance that is working less hard and less often is already saving you money on your heating and cooling bills, not to mention prolonging the life of the appliance itself and bringing the coziness back to every room in your home. Having a properly sealed home isn’t just about keeping drafts out. Poor seals can allow unwanted pollutants and allergens into your home as well, which naturally will affect the air quality of your home and cause extra trouble for allergy sufferers. Going along with that, moisture will find it’s way in wherever it can which can lead to a whole new world of mold, mildew and dry rot problems, essentially costing you even more time and money. Depending on the quality of your existing windows, you can expect to see a return on your investment in as little as two years, and continue to save money and your peace of mind for many years down the road. When you look at it this way, increasing the overall comfort, health and value of your home as well as positively affecting your peace of mind by something as simple as updating your old windows should be a no brainer.
